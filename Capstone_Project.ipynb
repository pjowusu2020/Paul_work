The city is situated in the west-central portion of the province along the Saint John River, which flows west to east as it bisects the city. By the 2016 Canadian Census, the city had a population of 58,220. It is the third-largest city in the province after Moncton and Saint John. There are a whole lot of venues and other attractive places in the town including government agencies, two universities. With the number of attractive places and government agencies, there is the need to do some quantitative explorations about some venues within the city. When a town has got so many facilities such as good universities, shopping centers, beaches, etc. leaders of the community are responsible for the peace and harmonious living of individuals and development of the community.\n\nA. Leaders of the town need to ensure that:\n\n1. Crime is under control in the town by finding out the cause of crimes and finding lasting solutions to them\n\n2. Modern tools such as Foursquare and other technologies are used to check the most common venues within the city\n\n3. Dinning places such as coffee shops and other snack shops are placed at vantage areas within the city so that they can be easily accessible to the residents and visitors who will require them during their stay in the town.\n \nB. Before any investor would decide to invest in a business of any kind in a town, they always look to the fact that certain conditions need to be satisfied. When someone is looking to open a restaurant or a contractor is trying to start a business in a town, at least, they make sure that certain factors have been met in the town. Some of these are;\n\n1. The population in the town: For a restaurant to be able to continually provide services to the people, it should get as many customers as possible to dine in it. Undoubtedly, Fredericton has the population to encourage investors into the town. Thus the most densely populated area in the town is ideal place to establish a restaurant.\n2. Investors will always have to make sure that their eating places and places of work are safe from intruders as areas with high crimes will definitely not attract a lot of customers especially at night time.\n\nThese are some of the problems that this project is willing to solve. We will make use of some data from the Fredericton open data site that will help us arrive at some conclusions and recommendations that will help investors make quality and informed \n\n"
